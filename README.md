## Hardware

- Arduino Uno
- Buzzer
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Middle-Sized Breadboard
- Male-to-Male jumper cables

## Set It Up

- plug your ultrasonic sensor's "VCC" pin to 5V on Arduino with a jumper cable
- Plug your ultrasonic sensor's "Echo" pin to Digitial I/O 9 on Arduino with a jumper cable
- plug your ultrasonic sensor's "Trig" pin to Digitial I/O 10 on Arduino with a jumper cable
- plug your ultrasonic sensor's "GND" pin to one of your GND pins on Arduino with a jumper cable
- plug your buzzer's one pin to "GND" on Arduino and the other pin to Digital I/O 8 with jumper cables.
- load the script to Arduino and then enjoy.
